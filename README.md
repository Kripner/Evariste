# Evariste

Code accompanying the research paper [HyperTree Proof Search for Neural Theorem Proving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11491).

For archival purposes -- this code does NOT run out of the box as we removed references to Meta-internal systems without fixing up entry points for generic setups.

Please view this code as an artifact accompanying the research paper with additional implementation details and as inspiration for future theorem proving systems. We do welcome PRs however that aim to make this repository more accessible.
